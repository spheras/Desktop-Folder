Automatic elementary code style guidelines
··········································
Build and install uncrustify, then go to src/ and run uncrustify like this:
$ uncrustify -c ../etc/uncrustify-elementary-vala.cfg */*.vala *.vala --replace --no-backup

There are one or two little quirks with the program though.

1. It adds a space to the underscore before translatable strings, as in:

    _("string")
    _ ("string")
    
I expect that's because it regards the underscore as the name of a function
(I believe it technically is). The code still works though. I included
LanguageText.vala once and then replaced _ ( with _(.

This is what you'd run to not include LanguageText.vala:

$ uncrustify -c ../etc/uncrustify-elementary-vala.cfg */*.vala Application.vala Resources.vala --replace --no-backup

2. Make sure you don't end comment lines with a \ (backslash), otherwise
uncrustify turns the next line into a comment as well:

    // This prints a \
    my_function ();

Gets turned into:

    // This prints a
    // my_function ();

It's okay if you put any character after it though:

    // This prints a \ character.
    // (or) This prints a \.
    my_function ();
